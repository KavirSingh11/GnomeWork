<h1>GnomeWork</h1>
<br/>
<h2>A Project Management App</h2>
<p >GnomeWork is a project management app that gameifies team based projects. The name is a play on words of homework, with the team members being gnomes 
(I guess that makes the PM Snow White?), who all compete to complete the get the most points in a given project.

<h3>Project Managers sign up as project managers to gain access to all the commands available which include</h3> 
  <ul>
    <li><h3>Creating a Project</h3>Projects are created using the large + button in the bottom right.</li>
    <li><h3>Adding Gnomes</h3> PMs add gnomes to their project by using emails in the creation form. New gnomes can always be added (enslaved?) by clicking the edit symbol next to the project name.</li>
    <li><h3>Creating Tasks</h3>The PM can add tasks after project creation by using the + button next to the project name.</li>
    <li><h3>Adding Point Values</h3>Every task is assigned a point value based on the perceived difficulty, this will result in those stubby little gnomes being tricked into fighting over who gets to serve you hardest.</li>
    <li><h3>Creating Teams</h3> PMs have the option to create a group (coven?) of gnomes that are automatically added to every new project they create by clicking the create team (herd?) option in the sidebar</li>
    <li><h3>Project Editing</h3>PMs have the power to edit every aspect of the project, they can change task assignments, task points, task names, project name, and add/remove <del>people</del> GNOMES on the project.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
<h3>Outside of selecting tasks and marking them as complete as they work, Gnomes can</h3> 
 <ul>
    <li><h3>Include Notes</h3>Gnomes can include notes on current or completed tasks, which can include current progress or taunts to competing gnomes.</li>
    <li><h3>Deselect Tasks</h3>Gnomes can deslect tasks for whatever reason, perhaps to take a higher point task or if their current task proves to difficult for their plebian little mind.</li>
    <li><h3>Flag Issues</h3>Gnomes can flag their task if they are having issues with it with an included note that all members assigned to the task can see. Other gnomes can comment on this flag providing suggestions to the little dummy or mock it for its failure.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Notes</h3> 
 <ul>
    <li><h3>Stack</h3>This app was created with React.JS, Express.JS, Node.JS, and MongoDB</li>
    <li><h3>Whats with the gnome thing?</h3>To be completely honest with you I was sleep deprived as hell and on my third coffee when I thought of the name GnomeWork and I thought it was too good to pass up on. When I realized that it was kinda stupid I was in too deep to change anything.</li>
    <li><h3>Me</h3>If you think this is kinda funny or cool, and want to get in touch you can message me on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kavir-singh-ryerson/"     >LinkedIn</a></li>
</ul>
